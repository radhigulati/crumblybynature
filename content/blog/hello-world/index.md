Welcome to my blog!

I'm super late to the blogging game, but as they say

Here are some things I'm hoping to write about:

- Programming
- Fitness
- Podcasts

I've been working through technical interview problems, so maybe you will watch me struggle through understanding linked list or BST concepts. Maybe we can struggle together.

I've been lifting weights 5x/week and I've been trying to understand the science behind certain exercises. Maybe we can struggle to understand the science together.

I listen to Joe Rogan's podcasts regularly. Some of the conversations are really fascinating and fun. Some of the conversations go over my head but maybe we can struggle to follow those conversations together.

What I'm saying is, maybe we can learn together.
