I decided to work on a difficulty: medium style problem on leetcode today because, why not

It went...ok.

I struggle through these problems and usually have a tough time coming up with the optimal solution but it's important to try!

The problem states

> Given an array `nums` of n integers where `n > 1`, return an array output such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.
